# Modeling surface composition of sand dunes

Main entry points:

### 1. ground-based-model.Rmd

Pixel based classification of ~50 close up photographs of Saugatuck Harbor Natural Area (SHNA) sand dune.

### 2. drone-based-model.Rmd

Multinomial regression with regularization predicting surface composition estimates from the ground-based model using multispectral drone imagery of SHNA.

### 3. map-creation.Rmd

Predicting surface composition across the entire stitched orthomosiac map of SHNA.

### 4. exploration.Rmd

Explore the training/testing data, follow single photograph (quadrat) through the ground-based model and the drone-based model.
